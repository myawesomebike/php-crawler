# Stand-Alone PHP Crawler

This (old) repo contains a stand-alone crawler that uses PHP and MySQL to process and save website crawl data.

Users can create a new crawl with the interface and monitor the progress of the crawl as it happens.  Once a crawl is complete users can review keyword statistics for the crawled content and compare crawls of individual pages or the entire crawl.
